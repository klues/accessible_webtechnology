# Task 3 - styling

In this task you'll **style of your web application**. Your **UI prototype** from course *UX Aspects* is the basis of this task. **Continue working on the app** like submitted in Task 2.

## What to do
* **choose one screen size** on which you'll focus your styling (desktop or mobile)
* choose one **type of navigation**
   * e.g. *navigation bar*, *burger menu* or *bottom navigation*, see slides
   * see `lecture_3/example_soluton` for examples:
      * `indexBottomNav.html` as example for a bottom navigation
      * `indexNavbar.html` as example for navigation bar and burger menu
* **implement the navigation type** you've selected to your app
* **style your components** according to your UI prototype (*UX aspects*) using CSS
   * use existing CSS file `css/main.css` or create an own one
   * make your elements "selectable" using `id` or `class` attributes - see slides
   * write CSS rules for applying the styles (you may also use AI assistance for this task) 

## Submission requirements

**Must haves**: 
* none - this task is not graded

**Recommended** (in order to be on track to be able to submit the final submission - Task 4):
* navigation works consistently
* most important views and components look like your defined them in your UI prototype (or at least similar)

## What to submit

* create a `.zip` archive of your project folder (e.g. "my-chat-app", the copy of the example solution) and upload it within this task.
* âš  **don't submit AI-generated code which you don't understand**
