# Usage of marp

The tool [marp](https://marp.app/) is used in order to create slides in `pdf` format out of the markdown for content of the lectures. This is the setup for VS Code. Of course you could also use something like [marp-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@marp-team/marp-cli).

- install [marp plugin for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode)
- settings in VS Code:
   - go to: `Preferences -> Settings -> Search for marp`
   - at `Themes` add `./slides/marp_themes/fhtw.css`
