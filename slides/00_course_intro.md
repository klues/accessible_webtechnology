# Accessible Webtechnology - Introduction

---

# Course Overview

The courses **Accessible Webtechnology** and **UX aspects of AAT** are connected.

The general idea of the courses is:

1. **UX Aspects**: create a mockup design for an individual app ✅
2. **Accessible Webtechnology**: create a functional prototype of the app
3. **UX Aspects**: do usability tests with the prototype
4. **Accessible Webtechnology**: improve the prototype based on usability test results
5. **Final presentation** of the results

---

# Learning outcomes

After the course **Accessible Webtechnology** you:

- understand how web applications work
- understand the concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- can transfer visual mockups to a simple interactive web app prototype
- can create contents of a web app using HTML
- add simple interactivity to a web app using JavaScript and VueJS
- understand how to style a web app using CSS
- know the most important aspects of an accessible web app
- can do basic accessibility tests of web apps using the NVDA or VoiceOver screen reader

Image generated by Gemini using this prompt:

`generate an image where novice webdeveloper directly jumps into a pool of dangerous webtechnologies. The pool looks a little bit dangerous, but the webdeveloper jumps in with joy. The pool should contain many symbols and brands related to web technologies. The symbols should not be symbols of apps, but technologies like HTML, JS, CSS, Vue.js, React, Angular, ...`

# Project-based learning

<blockquote>

Project-based learning **integrates knowing and doing**. Students learn knowledge and elements of the core curriculum but also apply what they know to **solve authentic problems** and produce results that matter...
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

... it **refocuses education on the student, not the curriculum** — a shift mandated by the global world, which rewards intangible assets such as **drive, passion, creativity, empathy, and resilience**. These cannot be taught out of a textbook, but must be activated through experience.
</blockquote>

# Project goal

The final prototype we create should:

* give a **good idea how the final app works and looks like**
* provide **basic interactivity** for important functionalities
* have **good accessibility** and **work with screen readers**

We will **NOT**:

- create a fully functional app
- use any backend, database or integration with an external service

<div class="box box-warn">
  ⚠️ <strong>Important</strong>: <em>Thinking and understanding</em> for yourself is more important than a great polished (AI generated) result!
</div>

# Project goal example

Imagine you're creating a **prototype for a messenger app**. The prototype could be able to:

- select contacts
- display conversations
- input and "send" messages (not really sending)
- maybe some special features

Your app will **NOT** be able to:

- really interact with other users
- store messages on the internet / in a cloud service

# Evaluation of performance

In total there are **4 Submissions** which focus on these topics:

1. Basic HTML templates and components
2. Interactivity using Javascript
3. Styling using CSS
4. Final submission including improvements from usability test from lecture "UX Aspects"

**Each submission consists of:**

* current state of the web app prototype
* explanation of important implementation details
* explanation of important difficulties and learnings
* test protocol of screen reader tests of specific use-cases

--- 
# Grading

The final grade results of:

* **80%**: Submissions Tasks 1-4
* **20%**: Final presentation
